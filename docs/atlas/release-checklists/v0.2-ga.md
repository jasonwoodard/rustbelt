# Atlas v0.2 GA Release Checklist

This checklist codifies the evidence required to declare Atlas v0.2 generally available. Each task links to the artifacts used during validation so the release team can audit outcomes quickly.

## 1. Pre-Flight Validation

### 1.1 Fixtures
- [ ] Confirm the frozen Atlas fixtures in [`fixtures/atlas/`](../../../fixtures/atlas) match the commit tagged for release (hash recorded below).
- [ ] Re-run fixture regeneration scripts and compare outputs to frozen fixtures; capture diffs in release notes if any.
- [ ] Attach regeneration logs to the release ticket.

### 1.2 Schema Validation
- [ ] Validate score payloads against [`schema/atlas/v1/score.schema.json`](../../../schema/atlas/v1/score.schema.json).
- [ ] Validate anchor payloads against [`schema/atlas/v1/anchor.schema.json`](../../../schema/atlas/v1/anchor.schema.json).
- [ ] Validate cluster payloads against [`schema/atlas/v1/cluster.schema.json`](../../../schema/atlas/v1/cluster.schema.json).
- [ ] Validate trace payloads against [`schema/atlas/v1/trace.schema.json`](../../../schema/atlas/v1/trace.schema.json).
- [ ] Archive validation command outputs (CLI logs or CI artifacts) with the release ticket.

### 1.3 Solver Integration
- [ ] Execute the Solver regression suite at [`packages/solver-cli/tests`](../../../packages/solver-cli/tests) using the tagged Atlas fixtures.
- [ ] Capture the CI run ID or local command output demonstrating Solver â‡„ Atlas compatibility.
- [ ] Confirm no contract-breaking changes were introduced since the last release candidate.

## 2. Documentation Review

- [ ] Review [`docs/atlas/releases/v0.2.md`](../releases/v0.2.md) for accuracy and update if needed.
- [ ] Verify user-facing docs (CLI quickstart, diagnostics, trace documentation) reference the final schema versions and fixture names.
- [ ] Ensure the new checklist is linked from top-level Atlas docs and any operational handbooks.
- [ ] Attach doc review notes or PR links to the release ticket.
